## Week 1 - History
- One writing system can be used by many languages
- Cuneiform works on a complex sexagesimal system
- The Epic of Gilgamesh was epic and an example of early literature
- Roman Numerals and Egyptian Numerals are other ancient number systems
- Typeface is the design or style of a set of characters
## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- Volatile memory is more short term, as it has immediate access but is lost when the power is turned off. RAM is a primary example of such.
- Non-Volatile memory is long term, used for storing data persistently even after the power is turned off. HDDs and SSDs are primary examples.
- Bytes are the units of measurement. There are Kilobytes, Megabites, Gigabytes and Terabytes. 1 KB = 1024 KBs.
- The ASCII table maps numbers to characters. It uses numbers up to 255, fitting perfectly into the 8-bit byte standard.
- Binary files are not meant to be read as text. Examples include images, executables or audio files.
## Week 3 - Markup Languages
- The concept of a Markup language comes from traditional publishing.
- Markdown is a simple markup language, designed to be easy to read and formatted into HTML.
- Other Markup languages include HTML, YAML, XML and Wiki text.
- HTML was initially proposed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN.
- In Markdown, the backslash (\) is the escape character. To show a literal #, you type `\#`. To show a literal *, you type `\*`.
## Week 4 - Keyboards and Editors
- QWERTY is the most prevalent layout globally for keyboards. DVORAK is an alternative layout.
- Most Keyboards use a rubber dome that collapses when you press it, registering the key press.
- Word Processors (Such as Microsoft Word) are designed for creating documents with rich formatting (fonts, styles, layouts, images).
- Text Editors: Designed for working with plain text files. They offer precise control over the raw text.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a text editor that comes with a variety of tools specifically designed for software development.
- github.dev is a convenient feature for quick edits to open a repo in a web browser version of VSCode.
## Week 5 - CLI
- Command Line Interfaces (CLI) are a way of interacting with a computer by typing text commands.
- **ls**: Lists files and directories in the current location.
- **cd**: Changes the directory.
- **cat file_name**: Concatenates and prints the entire content of a file to the terminal. It's non-interactive and exits immediately after printing.
