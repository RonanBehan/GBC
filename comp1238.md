## Week 1 - History
- One writing system can be used by many languages
- Cuneiform works on a complex sexagesimal system
- The Epic of Gilgamesh was epic and an example of early literature
- Roman Numerals and Egyptian Numerals are other ancient number systems
- Typeface is the design or style of a set of characters
## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- Volatile memory is more short term, as it has immediate access but is lost when the power is turned off. RAM is a primary example of such.
- Non-Volatile memory is long term, used for storing data persistently even after the power is turned off. HDDs and SSDs are primary examples.
- Bytes are the units of measurement. There are Kilobytes, Megabites, Gigabytes and Terabytes. 1 KB = 1024 KBs.
- The ASCII table maps numbers to characters. It uses numbers up to 255, fitting perfectly into the 8-bit byte standard.
- Binary files are not meant to be read as text. Examples include images, executables or audio files.
## Week 3 - Markup Languages
- The concept of a Markup language comes from traditional publishing.
- Markdown is a simple markup language, designed to be easy to read and formatted into HTML.
- Other Markup languages include HTML, YAML, XML and Wiki text.
- HTML was initially proposed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN.
- In Markdown, the backslash (\) is the escape character. To show a literal #, you type `\#`. To show a literal *, you type `\*`.
